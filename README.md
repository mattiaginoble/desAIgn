This is the repository for Figma plugin that generates through AI wireframe and UI, from a textual description.
Figma really needed a plugin to integrate artificial intelligence. So, as a university project and thesis, I built it.

Through the use of chatGPT, this plugin is able to analyze user-entered prompts and quickly create a ready-to-use wireframe on Figma.
This makes the idealization and protyping process much easier and faster.
It can be skillfully used to take cues and then create based on what has been created a complete and customized final design.
This plugin supports all versoion of Figma.
